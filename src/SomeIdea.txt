How to show that there is no more equitable alloc exist ? maybe add one ~alloc for each case in the lower rectangle of preference, 
compute MUS and get solution from there -Killian

CSP formulation is really natural, and seems fast even with a pure python backtracking only csp solver (python-constraint). While 
that's good if we want speed (probably use an existing CSP solver in another language), the problem with the CSP formulation is the
lack of MUS-like structure. One thing That should be tried is counter-factual explanation (found that in some paper, ask me if you want)
